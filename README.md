# Huffman Coding

This project contains an implementation of a huffman tree. Huffman tree is used to store data using less bits that it would use if stored normaly. Basically, it uses less bits to represent the most occurred characters. You can read about [Huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) if you want to learn morea bout it.

This project is implemented using C language. The IDE used is NetBeans 8.1 on a Ubuntu 14.04LTS operational system. At the moment only the tree is finished. You are free to use and edit this code, although I would be grateful if you give me credits for that.
